# 2D Hybrid AI Car Driving Simulator
Hybrid Intelligence for Safer Autonomous Driving
A 2D autonomous driving simulator that proves why Hybrid AI (Rules + ML + RL) is safer and more reliable than Pure Machine Learning for autonomous vehicles.

⭐ Designed for academic excellence, AI research, and recruiter visibility
## 🔥 Why This Project Stands Out

 - ❌ Pure ML fails in unseen & risky scenarios

 - ✅ Hybrid AI guarantees safety using rule-based overrides

 - 🧠 Combines Rule-Based Safety + Random Forest + Q-Learning

 - 📊 Clear performance comparison between Hybrid AI and Pure ML

 - 🎮 Real-time 2D simulation using Pygame

Key Insight:
Safety rules must override AI predictions in real-world autonomous systems.

## 🧠 What It Does (In One Minute)

 - Simulates a self-driving car in a 2D environment

 - Uses 7 ray-casting sensors (LIDAR-like perception)

 - Predicts steering & speed using Machine Learning

 - Learns optimal driving via Reinforcement Learning

 - Enforces collision avoidance & traffic rules using rule-based logic

 - Compares Hybrid AI vs Pure ML performance

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

 - Python

 - Pygame – Simulation & rendering

 - Scikit-learn – Random Forest (Classifier + Regressor)

 - Q-Learning – Reinforcement Learning

 - NumPy, Pandas – Data handling

 - Matplotlib – Performance visualization
